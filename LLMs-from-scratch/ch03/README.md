&nbsp;
## Main Chapter Code

- [01_main-chapter-code](01_main-chapter-code) contains the main chapter code.

&nbsp;
## Bonus Materials

- [02_bonus_efficient-multihead-attention](02_bonus_efficient-multihead-attention) implements and compares different implementation variants of multihead-attention
- [03_understanding-buffers](03_understanding-buffers) explains the idea behind PyTorch buffers, which are used to implement the causal attention mechanism in chapter 3



In the video below, I provide a code-along session that covers some of the chapter contents as supplementary material.
