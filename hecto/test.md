# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that
you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext
text documents. Created by _John Gruber_ in 2004,
Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.
Using Markdown is different than using a **WYSIWYG** editor.
In an application like Microsoft Word,
you click buttons to format words and phrases,
and the changes are visible immediately.
Markdown isn’t like that. When you create
a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown
syntax to the text to indicate which words
and phrases should look different.
